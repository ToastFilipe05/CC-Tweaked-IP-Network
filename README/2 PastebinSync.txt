Synced Across Pastebin and Github

Updater.lua
FileServer.lua
HostServer.lua
Client.lua 
Router.lua
Switch.lua
WirelessClient.lua (Untested)
CellTower.lua (Untested)
TrafficlightController/Node.lua

These files are not the same across Pastebin and Github

N/A

You can find all of these files from updater.lua, worst case senario use this command and you can

pastebin get cYVhLAtp updater.lua

then you should have access to all the latest versions of the files (THESE FILES CAN SOMETIMES BE BUGGY SINCE THEY ARE THE LATEST VERSION 
AND SOMETIMES NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL, DON'T REPORT BUGS IN THIS VERSION)

If you don't like using the pastebin over and over you can access computer's and disks directly in your world by going into your minecraft location then 
/saves/yoursave/computercraft/computers or /computercraft/disks the ID's match folder names you can just paste the files from github into those locations and
even edit them directly

Wired Network is fully functional when it comes to infrastructure, I still want to upgrade certian parts with better security and configuration

wireless network is not in the best condition and is still untested
