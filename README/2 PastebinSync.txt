These files are not the same across pastebin and github

Client.lua (Pastebin version untested)
HostServer.lua (Pastebin version untested)
FileServer.lua (Pastebin version untested)
wirelessClient.lua (Pastebin version untested)
cellTower.lua (Pastebin version untested)
Updater.lua (Pastebin version untested, but most likely works perfectly)

You can find all of these files from updater.lua, I think, worst case senario use this command and you can

pastebin get cYVhLAtp updater.lua

then you should have access to all the latest versions of the files (THESE FILES CAN SOMETIMES BE BUGGY SINCE THEY ARE THE LATEST VERSION 
AND SOMETIMES NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL, DON'T REPORT BUGS IN THIS VERSION)

if you want a fully functional experience right now the wired network is fully functional albeit kinda early with functionallity in my opinion, wireless network
is not in the best condition and I'm not ready to publicly release it
