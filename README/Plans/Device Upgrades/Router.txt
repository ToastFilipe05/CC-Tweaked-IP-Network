Make a denial of routing configuration

steps:

1: Make a configuration variables called denySrc, denyDst, whLst, and blkLst
2: Make a denyList array variable that will hold IP addresses and IP Subnets that can be checked later on
3: 
    3.a: Make a if statement that checks if denySrc is true and if statement that checks if denyDst is true
    3.b: Make both if statements look to see weather the whLst or blkLst is true
    3.c: Check the incoming src or dst matches any entries in associated list with a for loop
    3.d If they match in whitelist they are allowed to continue otherwise they are dropped
    3.e If they match in blacklist they are dropped otherwise they continue
4: Make CLI configuration of Denial of routing with commands as follows
    'deny routes enable <src,dst>' - sets either denySrc or denyDst to true (Both could be true)
    'denylist is white' - sets whLst to true and makes sure blkList is false
    'denylist is black' - sets blkLst to true and makes sure whLst is false
    'add denylist <IP Address or subnet>' - adds a subnet or IP address to denyList
    'remove denylist <IP Address or subnet> ' - removes a subnet or IP address from whitelist
    'show <denyList>' - shows whitelist or blacklist entries
    'clear <denyList>' - clears whitelist or blacklist entries


potential code for each step:

1: set vars
local denySrc = false
local denyDst = false
local whLst = false
local blkLst = false
2:set
local denyList = {}
3:
local function listener()
    while not terminated do
        local e, side, ch, reply, msg, dist = os.pullEvent("modem_message")
        if interfaces[side] and type(msg)=="table" and msg.uid then
          if denySrc == true then
            if whLst == true then
              for entr in denyList do
                if entr.match then --I know this does not work just using as placeholder
                  forwardPacket(msg, side)
                end
              end
              return
            elif blkLst == true then
              for entr in denyList do
                if entr.match then --Same here
                  return
                end
              end
              forwardPacket(msg, side)
            end
        elseif denyDst == true then
           --code matches above
        else
             forwardPacket(msg,side)
        end
    end
end
