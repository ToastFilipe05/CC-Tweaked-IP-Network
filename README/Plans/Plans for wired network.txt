Continue updating to multi-channel system
I've been lazy to updating the github and I want to make sure everything is compatable before moving over

THESE ARE ONLY ON PASTEBIN VERSION CURRENTLY
current fully integrated devices, with both multi-channel and switch discovery support

switch.lua 
hostServer.lua (if you want this has packet handling for S_H packets (switch hello) you could just copy and paste under the right places in other files)
client.lua

devices that have multi-channel support, but not integrated with new switch discovery

router.lua
fileServer.lua

devices that have no multi-channel support and not integrated with new switch discovery
Wireless devices are getting support last because a bug slowed multi-channel integration

cellTower.lua
wirelessClient.lua
