  Banking Over IP these plans are very primitive and will be changed because I will be trying to implement some sort of compatability 
with the mod lightman's currency

  Make the client.lua have the ability to launch other programs in multi-shell so the bank user program doesn't have to be fully integrated into the client

  Make a bank program that on bootup will contact a server with ip address of 201.200.99.99 and request information from a file that has 
account info like account name, money and account ID (6 digit number always starting with 874) the file shouldn't be sent to the computer 
just information from the file, if the computer can't find a acct.txt file in its dir it should create a acct.txt file and prompt the user for 
an account name then it sends an c_acct_request to the server, the server should then make a new .txt file with the information from the c_acct_request, 
the name of the file should be the account ID ex.874001.txt, which it should get from a variable stored in a separate file called varacct.txt which it's 
only purpose should be to keep track of the latest acct number ex. First account ID 874001, then when a new account is being made the variable goes up by 
one making the new account ID 874002, the 874xxx.txt files should look like this:
[Account Name: c_acct_request_name
Account ID: 874xxx
Balance: 0 ]

  Then the server will update a monitor connected to the server saying "Physical accounts needed :x" the server should only 
decrease this variable when a computer from the bank network (192.168.99) sends a CONSTRUCTED packet (the packet should only contain the 
computer's associated AccountID and balance). The server should send a message to the bank client that says, 
"Please head to 110 Minecart Ln to deposit cash" after receiving the c_acct_request, the bank sever should then return to waiting for packets

  There should be computers called physical account that have an assigned account ID and they will be connected to a 
physical storage and the computer will first look inside the physical storage and make a CONSTRUCTED packet that will have 
information like AccountID of the computer, and the cash that exists in the physical storage, cash will be represented like this for now
Iron nugget = $0.01
Gold nugget = $1.00
Iron Ingot = $0.10
Gold Ingot= $10.00
Diamond = $100.00
Netherite Ingot = $1000.00
There should also be an update_balance packet sent to the bank server every 15 seconds this packet will contain AccountID 
and current balance in the physical storage

  Next a online spending feature should be made, first a marketplace needs to be made for the client the marketplace should pull from the hosts.txt to 
find store servers [create a way to tag host translations and the program will look for store tag] store servers will not need a password to access the 
information from inventory.txt which will have information formatted like so:

[Item] x[quantity] $[price]

  The server should have commands that allow the store to set prices and items without having to manually add them to the inventory.txt file 
next the server should be connected to a physical inventory that holds all the items the store wants to sell online and only updates the quanity 
of the items  to inventory.txt either when the update inventory command is ran or on bootup.

  Clients will first need to enter a command called shop [store server name] this command should start a dialog with the store server basically just 
going to automatically fill in the store server ip when otherwise it would be a required feild
The user will now be able to enter the commands inventory and buy, inventory will send a request to the store server to display the store's 
inventory without actually sending the inventory.txt file. When the user tries to purchase an item with the buy command they will fill out the 
required fields, user name, user bank acctid, physical address, the item they want to purchase and the quanity of said item. The computer will then 
construct a sell_request packet which sends (user name, user bank acctid, user physical address, item, quantity) to the store server where the server 
will then send a transfer_request packet to the bank server that contains (src account, dst account) the bank server will try to transfer the cash 
from the src account balance to the dst account balance if this is successful the bank will send a transferred packet the store server will then add 
the sell_request information to a connected monitor like so:


John Doe, Minecart lane 129, stick, 5
Jillian Hank, Mineshaft road 145, coal, 32
[User name], [user physical address] [item], [quantity]

  And the quanity of the item will be removed from inventory.txt to avoid double purchases, to remove a entry from the monitor an employee should 
have to enter a delivered command with the argument of the user name this will remove the first instance of that user name to avoid accidental 
deletion when two sell_request share the same user name


  If the transfer is unsuccessful the bank will send a insufficient_balance packet the store server will then send it's own insufficient_balance 
packet that once the client receives the packet prints to the user "Failed purchase, insufficient balance"
