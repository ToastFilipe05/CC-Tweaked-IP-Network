I am a computer science major switching from IT and I thought this would be a fun little project.

Don't expect for me to respond to bug reports or to have any urgency to fixing them if I even receive a report
I'm also not going to complain if you steal all this code and reshare it elsewhere
use this in any server or modpack you want (I don't know how you'd get this in a modpack, but I've seen crazier things)

Use the How to use.txt (Hasn't been completed) to learn how to set up your own network in your world and to get started making your own files/devices that 
interact with the IP networking

Keep up with my work here https://trello.com/b/KShbZV8M

IMPORTANT NOTE
Right now the current code in Github should work, but the code in pastebin doesn't, I've been working on this project non-stop for weeks now and I've grown tired of trying to fix the couple of bugs it has, everytime I fix one another one pops up, so for now I'm on hiatus, I might return to fix it (knowing how stubborn I am I might be back on it within the week) but there's also a chance I don't so I'm putting this message here for anyone curious

The Github page is also incomplete as I was fist going to get the basic infrastructure working before moving onto the HOW TO's and extra IP dependent lua files

If the code on github doesn't work I am sorry, but if it does, you need to make your own pastebin for each file for now
You can even fix the updater on your own by replacing the pastebin codes it should work fine since it's a really simple code with very few points of failure
