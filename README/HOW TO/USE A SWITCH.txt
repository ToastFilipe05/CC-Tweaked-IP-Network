Simplest to set up just add a default route with the channel of the connected device 
(The channel is equal to the computer ID of the device, ex. routers ip is 10.10.10.<ComputerID> 
so the channel for 10.10.10.5 would be 5)

'discover' command is to re-discover connected devices since switches do NOT automatically discover periodically
only on boot

'show' is to show currently connected devices
