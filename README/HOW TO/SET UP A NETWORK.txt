First you want to make tunnels running under your "City"
These tunnels should be 3x3 and a minimum of 5 blocks under your ground level
this is so you can surround your networking tunnels with a hard block so not 
just anyone can break into the tunnel and destroy your network

Secondly you want to come up with a plan of where your devices are going to be,
something like this would help

Office 1 computer --------- Switch --------- Office 1 computer
                              |
                              |
                              |
Office 1 computer --------- Switch --------- Office 1 server
                              |
                              |
                              |
                       Endpoint Router
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
 Office 3 Router ------ Main Network Router ------- Office 2 network
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
Main Network Router -- Central Router ------- Office 4 Router


This plan will be immensely helpful when building your network
Once you have all the Computers placed following your network plan,
you first want to set up the routers and switches starting from the inside out
First start with your central router(s) they have no default route and will 
know all the subnets in your network, for example lets say the subnets worked like so
Office 1: 192.168.57
Office 2: 192.168.12
Office 3: 192.168.78
Office 4: 192.168.18
and hypothetically the other Main Network Router connected to Central router was connected to 
Office 5: 192.168.240
Office 6: 192.168.140
Office 7: 192.168.182

The central router would have to know that the subnets of Office 1-4 are the back modem
and that Office 5-7  are on the left modem, but the Main Network Router would only have 
to know Office 1-4's associated modems, same applies to the other Main Network Router
Endpoint routers only have to know their directly connected subnets

Central router's do not have any default route Unless you split your network in two 
halfs where you have two central routers that know each of their own sides basically 
making them act as two Main Network Routers treating each other as the central router

Endpoint and Main Network Routers do have a default route that points 
toward the central router who will know where to send the packet
or if they should just drop the unknown address

So when making your network find your Central Router and add routes to every 
subnet that connects in any way to the central router, next on your 
Main Network Routers add all the subnets that are on that side 
of the connected central router and set the default route toward the Central Router

Endpoint routers just need a default route and they should be completely set up

Switches are instantly set up once you start them and enter a side (this is for default route) (this is being changed)

Servers are variable and set up most of the time like a client check their specific HOW TO file for more info

Clients only need you to set an IP address and it should try to follow the 192.168._._ format, otherwise it might mess something up

Other IP conventions to follow are 
Routers always start with 10.10.10 and the last number is decieded with their computer ID so to avoid any overlap (automatic)
Servers always follow the 201.200._._ format (manual)
Switches never have an IP as they only forward packets to learned hosts and through the default route (manual)

The network admin (You most likely) should always keep track of the IP addressing so they don't accidently overlap with other existing IP addresses this could seriously mess up your network and even cause snooping, if you want 100% certainty that snooping doesn't occur always use Endpoint Routers and never connect networks directly to Main Network Routers, this means that even if someone has changed their IP to try and snoop they can't because the Main Network Router will always route to the set route of that IP 
(ex. snooper wants to see traffic meant for 192.178.14.12 but you set all networks connected to Endpoint Routers and the snooper is connected to its original network of 192.168.10, the Main Network Router only knows that the Endpoint router has the 192.186.10 network not the 192.178.14 network so that traffic is never sent instead the snooper can't get any traffic outside it's Endpoint Router)

You can make your own IP addressing formats to use it doesn't matter for the wired network at all as long as it follows the _._._._ format nothing else matters to the .lua code

To use a different IP addressing format on wireless however you would have to change some of the code where it detects nearby cell towers, otherwise it should be fine
