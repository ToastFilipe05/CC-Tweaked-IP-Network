First you want to make tunnels running under your "City"
These tunnels should be 3x3 and a minimum of 5 blocks under your ground level
this is so you can surround your networking tunnels with a hard block so not 
just anyone can break into the tunnel and destroy your network

Secondly you want to come up with a plan of where your devices are going to be,
something like this would help

Office 1 computer --------- Switch --------- Office 1 computer
                              |
                              |
                              |
Office 1 computer --------- Switch --------- Office 1 server
                              |
                              |
                              |
                       Endpoint Router
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
 Office 3 Router ------ Main Network Router ------- Office 2 network
                              |
                              |
                              |
                              |
Main Network Router -- Central Router ------- Office 4 Router


This plan will be immensely helpful when building your network
Once you have all the Computers placed following your network plan,
you first want to set up the routers and switches starting from the inside out
First start with your central router(s) they have no default route and will 
know all the subnets in your network, for example lets say the subnets worked like so
Office 1: 192.168.57
Office 2: 192.168.12
Office 3: 192.168.78
Office 4: 192.168.18
and hypothetically the other Main Network Router connected to Central router was connected to 
Office 5: 192.168.240
Office 6: 192.168.140
Office 7: 192.168.182

The central router would have to know that the subnets of Office 1-4 are the back modem
and that Office 5-7  are on the left modem, but the Main Network Router would only have 
to know Office 1-4's associated modems, same applies to the other Main Network Router
Endpoint routers only have to know their directly connected subnets

Central router's do not have any default route but you could make a Central Network something like this

        City 1                          City 2                                                                    City 3                            City 4
          |                                |                                                                         |                                  |
Central Network Router --------- Central Network Router --------- True Central Network Router --------- Central Network Router --------- Central Network Router
          |                                |                                                                        |                                  |
        City 5                         City 6                                                                      City 7                          City 8

The True Central Network Router will know all networks connected to your overall network you could make a "Second" Central network where the two True Central Network Routers are connected and are each other's default routes

One day I might impliment a NAT solution to make this Central Router less of a need, but for now this is the most complex large networking available

Endpoint and Main Network Routers do have a default route that points 
toward the central router/network who will know where to send the packet
or if they should just drop the unknown address

So when making your network find your Central Router/Network and add routes to every 
subnet that connects in any way to the central router/network, next on your 
Main Network Routers add all the subnets that are on that side 
of the connected central router and set the default route toward the Central Router
The farther away from the central router they are the less subnets they need to know For example a 
Main Network Router that is 5 router away from the central router only needs to know the subnets 
"downstream" of it and can just use the default route for unknown subnets AKA the ones "upstream"
While the Main Network Router that is just 2 routers away from the central router needs to know all
almost half of the subnets that the Central router does

Endpoint routers just need a default route and they should be completely set up

Switches are set up once you first have the rest of the network set up then boot the switch, after that you need to input 
the command 'default route <side> <Channel of connected device on side>' then it is set up completely, if you accidently booted
the switch before all connected devices you can run the 'discover' command to make it learn about the connected devices
the switches are made like this to avoid clog since routers already constantly discover hosts and switches are supposed to be
as lightweight as possible in this networking protocol

Servers are variable and set up, most of the time, like a client check their specific HOW TO file for more info

Clients only need you to set an IP address and it should try to follow the 192.168._._ format, otherwise it might mess something up

Other IP conventions to follow are 
Routers always start with 10.10.10 and the last number is decieded with their computer ID so to avoid any overlap (automatic)
Servers always follow the 201.200._._ format (manual)
Switches never have an IP as they only forward packets to learned hosts and through the default route (manual)

The network admin (You most likely) should always keep track of the IP addressing so they don't accidently overlap with
other existing IP addresses this could seriously mess up your network and even cause snooping, if you want 100% certainty
that snooping doesn't occur always use Endpoint Routers and never connect networks directly to Main Network Routers, this 
means that even if someone has changed their IP to try and snoop they can't because the Main Network Router will always route 
to the set route of that IP (ex. snooper wants to see traffic meant for 192.178.14.12 but you set all networks 
connected to Endpoint Routers and the snooper is connected to its original network of 192.168.10, the Main Network Router only 
knows that the Endpoint router has the 192.186.10 network not the 192.178.14 network so that traffic is never sent instead the 
snooper can't get any traffic outside it's Endpoint Router)

You can make your own IP addressing formats to use, it doesn't matter for 
the wired network at all, as long as it follows 
the _._._._ format nothing else matters to the code

To use a different IP addressing format on wireless however you would have to change some of the code where it detects nearby cell towers, otherwise it should be fine
