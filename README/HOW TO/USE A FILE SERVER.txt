The File Server is useful for transfering files that need to be distributed among many different clients

The File Server is set up by first setting up the IP address
If you aren't the ISP in your world then ask for a server IP from the ISP
If you are the ISP the server IP should be 201.200._._

Next you need to make a password for the File Server
if you want to make the file server public you just 
need to restart the device without setting a password

ONLY FILES FOUND IN THE '/files/' DIRECTORY CAN BE TRANSFERRED (this is automatically created on startup)
