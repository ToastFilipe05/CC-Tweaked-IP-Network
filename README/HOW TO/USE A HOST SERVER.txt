The Host Server is setup by giving it a IP address and then adding host name translations

Set the IP with the 'setip' command
Add hosts with the 'addhost' command (ex. addhost DargIncFileServer 201.200.40.1 DargInc FTPSVR)
Hosts is very similar to DNS and can even be used the same way (ex. addhost DargInc.com/FTP 201.200.40.1 DargInc FTPSVR | and | DargInc.com/Bank 201.200.40.2 DargInc BANKSVR)
