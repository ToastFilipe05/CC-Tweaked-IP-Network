# Block-Net Protocol - An IP based network for CC: Tweaked

Block-Net Protocol or BNP is a protocol made for CC: Tweaked that loosely follows real life patterns with IP like addressing and devices that share similarites to their real-life counterparts it also includes a client device with a custom OS ToasterOvenOS which has it's own features and can somewhat work on it's own albeit with far less features

To find almost all files use this command:
"wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToasterOvenDev/Block-Net-Protocol-IP-Network-for-CC-Tweaked/refs/heads/Stable/UtilityFiles/Updater.lua updater.lua"

To get ToasterOvenOS use this command:

The wiki explains how to use the entire system including set-up and features of each device

Block-Net Protocol was made on CC:Tweaked version 1.116.2 but should work on almost any version of Computer Craft that runs Basalt or has access to syntax used in CLI versions
