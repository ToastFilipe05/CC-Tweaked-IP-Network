# Block-Net Protocol - An IP based network for CC: Tweaked

Block-Net Protocol or BNP is a protocol made for CC: Tweaked that loosely follows real life patterns with IP like addressing and devices that share similarites to their real-life counterparts it also includes a client device with a custom OS ToasterOvenOS which has it's own features and can somewhat work on it's own albeit with far less features


The wiki explains how to use the entire system including set-up and features of each device
